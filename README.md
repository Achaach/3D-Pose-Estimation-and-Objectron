# 3D-Pose-Estimation-and-Objectron

## Introduction
Objectron is a 3D object detection and tracking tool developed by Google. It allows for the detection and tracking of 3D objects in real-time using a single RGB camera. Objectron uses machine learning algorithms to generate a 3D bounding box around the detected object and estimate its 3D pose.

 this project aims to develop a robust and efficient 3D object detection and tracking system using 3D pose estimation and Objectron techniques. The system can be used in various applications such as robotics, self-driving cars, and augmented reality.
 
 ## Outline
1. 3D bounding box detection on 2D images
2. Estimation of world coordinates of the camera
3. Human Pose Detection
4. Projection of 2D pose estimation to 3D world coordinates
5. Intersection between Pose and Objectron
